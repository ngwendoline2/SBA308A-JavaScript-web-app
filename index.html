        The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural
        resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment,
        education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National
        Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural
        and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this
        country and the world.

        Since 1916, the National Park Service has been entrusted with the care of
        our national parks. With the help of volunteers and partners, we safeguard
        these special places and share their stories with more than 318 million
        visitors every year. But our work doesn't stop there.
